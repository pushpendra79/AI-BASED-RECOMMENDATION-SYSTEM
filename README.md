## Internship Task 4 – AI-Based Recommendation System

### About the Task  
This repository contains the implementation for Internship Task 4, where I developed an *AI-based Recommendation System* using Java and the *Apache Mahout* library. The aim was to simulate how modern recommendation engines work — like those used by e-commerce websites, streaming platforms, and social media — by analyzing user preferences and generating intelligent suggestions.

The project combines basic machine learning techniques with practical software engineering to demonstrate a real-world use case of personalized content delivery.

### Objective  
The main goal of this task was to implement *collaborative filtering* — a widely used technique in recommendation systems — using Apache Mahout. The system takes in user-item interaction data and provides tailored recommendations for a given user. This helped me understand how user behavior can be analyzed and used to drive smart product or content suggestions.

### Tools and Technologies Used  
- *Java:* Core programming language for building the logic and integrating libraries.  
- *Apache Mahout:* Open-source machine learning library used for implementing scalable collaborative filtering.  
- *IntelliJ IDEA:* IDE used for coding, debugging, and project management. Its intelligent features made development smoother and faster.  
- *Google:* Essential for researching documentation, resolving errors, and finding sample datasets.  
- *YouTube:* Helpful for understanding collaborative filtering concepts and Mahout implementation via video tutorials.  
- *ChatGPT:* Provided support in clarifying algorithm behavior, improving code readability, and generating documentation summaries.

### Features  
- Developed entirely in Java using the Apache Mahout framework.  
- Implements *user-based* and *item-based collaborative filtering*.  
- Works with a sample dataset for demonstration.  
- Clean and modular code for easy understanding and scalability.  
- Lightweight design, making it easy to integrate into larger applications or systems.

### How It Works  
The application processes a dataset of user-item ratings or preferences.  
1. It calculates similarities either between users or between items.  
2. Based on these similarities, it predicts and recommends items that a user might like.  
3. The recommendations are generated efficiently using Mahout’s internal algorithms.  

To use it, simply run the program with the appropriate dataset, and it will output recommendations for the specified user.

### Applicability  
This kind of recommendation system has real-world relevance in a variety of fields:  
- *E-commerce:* Product recommendations based on shopping behavior (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart).  
- *Streaming Services:* Suggesting movies, shows, or music (e.g., Netflix, YouTube, Spotify).  
- *Social Media:* Recommending friends, content, or pages (e.g., Instagram, Facebook).  
- *News Platforms:* Delivering personalized news feeds (e.g., Google News).  
- *E-Learning:* Course or content recommendations (e.g., Coursera, Udemy).

### Conclusion  
This internship task gave me valuable experience in applying machine learning concepts practically using Java. Building this recommendation system helped me understand collaborative filtering in depth and gave me hands-on exposure to working with external libraries like Apache Mahout.

Alongside that, using IntelliJ IDEA for development and platforms like YouTube, Google, and ChatGPT for support allowed me to learn efficiently, debug issues faster, and structure the project in a way that mirrors real-world development workflows. The knowledge gained here will definitely help me in future data-driven and AI-based projects.
